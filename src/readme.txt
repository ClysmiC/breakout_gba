Breakout! By Andrew Smith -- asmith379

This is a classic breakout game. As you break bricks, an image will be revealed underneath them. Position the paddle accordingly under the ball to control which way the ball rebounds (e.g., if you barely tip the ball with the left of the paddle, the ball will be sent more to the left than if you hit the ball right in the middle of the paddle).

DMA is used to draw the bricks, the under-image, and the startscreen, win-screen, and lose-screen.

Press A to launch the ball from your paddle at the beginning.

Good luck!
